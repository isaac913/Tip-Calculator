Tip-Calculator
==============
This is the Tip Calculator I created for prework of codepath February iOS bootcamp in SF
* It took me around 2 hours to finish this project.
* I have completed the requird stories as below:
  1. calculte tip base on bill amount and update the total instantly.
  2. using a tip percentage segment controll to change the tip percentage and update the tip and total instantly
  3. clicking on background of view will dismiss keyboard.
  
Optional stories:
*  Remember the bill amount across app restarts. After an extended period of time, clear the state. This is a UI trick that    Apple uses with the Spotlight app. If you return there a minute later, it will show your most recent search. if you return 10 minutes later, it defaults to blank. To implement this, plug into the application lifecycle and track time using NSDate.
*  Add a light/dark color theme to the settings view. In viewWillAppear, update views with the correct theme colors.
*  prevent double decimal point in the text field
*  bill amount can not excess 50,000,000
